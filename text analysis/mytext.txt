The study, appearing today in Science Advances, examines the paleoclimate record of the last 66 million years, during the Cenozoic era, which began 
shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs. The scientists found that during this period, fluctuations in the Earth's climate experienced a surprising
"warming bias." In other words, there were far more warming events -- periods of prolonged global warming, lasting thousands to tens of thousands of 
years -- than cooling events. What's more, warming events tended to be more extreme, with greater shifts in temperature, than cooling events.

The researchers say a possible explanation for this warming bias may lie in a "multiplier effect," whereby a modest degree of warming -- for instance 
from volcanoes releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- naturally speeds up certain biological and chemical processes that enhance these 
fluctuations, leading, on average, to still more warming.
